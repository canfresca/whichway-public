        <h2>Introduction</h2>
  		<p>WhichWay ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). By using the App, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>User Input:</strong> Text preferences and image files submitted through the App.</li>
			<li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Non-personally identifiable technical information such as device type and OS version.</li>
			<li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When users create an account, we collect email address, display name, and authentication tokens. These are stored securely using Firebase Authentication.</li>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
  <h2>Data Storage, Security and Retenion</h2>
  <p>Uploaded images and text are stored temporarily and processed to generate recommendations. Images are uploaded to secure, privacy-conscious services like Cloudinary. User preferences, images, and recommendations may be saved to a secure database such as Firebase Firestore.</p>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, but no system is 100% secure.</p>
  <p>Uploaded images and inputs are retained only as long as needed for processing. Authenticated user data is retained for as long as the account is active and is deletable upon request.</p>

            <li><strong>Firebase</strong>: We use Firebase for authentication, analytics, and database.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these services has their own privacy policies that govern how they handle your data.</p>
